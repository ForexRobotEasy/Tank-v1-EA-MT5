# Tank v1 EA MT5

This code represents an Expert Advisor (EA) for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform, called Tank v1. The EA is designed to automate the trading process, making it easier for traders to execute trades based on specific conditions.

## Global Variables
- `dailyTradeCount`: Keeps track of the number of trades executed in a day.
- `lastTradeTime`: Stores the timestamp of the last trade executed.

## OnTick Event
The `OnTick` event is triggered on each tick of the market. This function is responsible for checking if it is a Friday and if a trade has already been executed for the day. If these conditions are met, the function proceeds to place pending orders based on certain conditions.

## OnTimer Event
The `OnTimer` event is triggered at regular intervals. In this code, it is used to check if the end of the day has been reached. If the time elapsed since the last trade is greater than or equal to one day, all open orders are closed and the `dailyTradeCount` is reset to zero.

## Functions to Manage Orders
The code includes the following functions to manage orders:
- `PlaceBuyStopOrder`: Implements the logic to place a Buy Stop order with specified stop loss and take profit levels.
- `PlaceSellStopOrder`: Implements the logic to place a Sell Stop order with specified stop loss and take profit levels.
- `CloseAllOrders`: Implements the logic to close all open orders.

## Helper Functions
The code also includes helper functions to determine if conditions are met to place a Buy Stop or Sell Stop order, and to calculate the stop loss and take profit levels based on risk management rules.
